少しだけど、自信を持てた気がするわ=It's just a bit, but I feel more confident in myself.
特に意識はしていなかったけれど、貴方が言うならそうなのかも=I don't really think I am, but if you say so, then it might be true.
少し褒めすぎよ……でも……嬉しいわ=You're exaggerating... but... I'm happy.
……大げさな褒め方ね=...You're exaggerating too much.
……どこを褒めたら喜ぶか、熟知してる感じね。……悔しいけど、嬉しいわ=...You sure do know how to give compliments to make people delighted... It's frustrating, but I'm happy.
私って、こんなに単純だったかしら。こんな褒め言葉で喜んじゃうなんて……=Maybe I really am that simple. To feel so happy with such a cheap compliment...
悪い気はしないわ。……これは本心よ=This isn't so bad... I'm being honest.
……本心から思っていないでしょ？　そういうの、伝わるものよ=...You didn't really mean that, right? It's easy to see through that.
